# Plant a Pollinator Garden

In the United States, June 17-23, 2024, is National Pollinator Week. Pollinators play important roles in our ecosystems and by growing native plants we can help support pollinators. As an amateur gardener, I was excited to see that the Pollinator Partnership has a tool called “[Find Your Roots]([url](https://www.pollinator.org/find-your-roots-tool)),” which helps you identify pollinator friendly plants that are native to your area and suitable to your garden’s conditions. This National Pollinator Week, I adapted “Find Your Roots” into an interactive Twine game that helps you find plants to go in your pollinator garden called “Plant a Pollinator Garden.” The Twine game focuses on pollinator friendly plants that are native to Boston, Massachusetts and Oakland, California. It first identifies the ecoregion for each city and then recommends native plants based on whether your garden will be shady or sunny. Once you select your plants, it tells you which pollinators you helped by planting them.
